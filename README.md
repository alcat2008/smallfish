Smallfish is an out-of-the-box React framework based on [umi](https://umijs.org/). Smallfish has a lot of built-in development tools and function libraries. It allows users to focus on the business to be developed in a contractual way, without having to entangle and consume energy in the underlying tools and configuration. Everything is relaxed.

## Features

- Built-in react, antd, antd pro, dva and other functions, only need to rely on a smallfish
- Built-in routing to complete complex routing needs with convenient routing configuration
- Built-in dev, build, eslint, stylelint and other functions
- Default support typescript, zero configuration use
- On-off mode for config, extremely easy to use
- Create your own proprietary tools via plugins based on smallfish
